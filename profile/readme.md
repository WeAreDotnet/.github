# Welcome to WeAreDotnet

- As seen on the dotnet-content-creators list, your name, channels, and tags would be listed as a nicely-looking creator card on this domain: [We Are .NET](https://www.WeAreDotnet.io)
- You can remove your card later on at any time. 
- Please write to us if you want to be excluded from this process (issue, Twitter or LinkedIn direct message).

 We want to list your creator info on a new community platform Tim and I (Matthias) are developing.
 The community will be tailored to you as a content creator and include a visually appealing replacement for the current markdown table list.
  
We are also thinking about additional features:
- Feed Aggregation (public access)
- Discord Chat (creators-only access)
- Everything is non-profit; everything is just for fun!

Please feel free to open an issue in this repository for any questions.
  
We are also happy to answer questions via Twitter or LinkedIn direct messages.
